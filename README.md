# Website for [Najma Tours and Travel](https://najmatravel.com/).

The site uses the [HTML5-Boilerplate Template Repo](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate-template) and the [Scrolling Nav template from Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template/scrolling-nav)

The HTML5-Boilerplate Template uses Webpack for development and to prepare assets for production, but our production target is Github Pages, so the production process is not used.

For development:

`npm run start`
